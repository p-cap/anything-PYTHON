# anything-PYTHON
My personal collection of different python scripts to showcase my proficiency as a Python Developer and remember...this is not the end    
NOTE: Some of the scripts can be refactored for scalability

# Scripts

  This directoty contains examples of data structures and algorithms written in Python
- [Decode.py](https://github.com/p-cap/anything-PYTHON/tree/main/CTF)     
  The code above was developed during a CTF challenge that decrpyted a ciphertext that was XOR'd with a 5-byte key
- [Portscanner.py](https://github.com/p-cap/anything-PYTHON/blob/main/portscanner.py)

- [verify-sha256.py](https://github.com/p-cap/anything-PYTHON/blob/main/verify-sha256.py)    
  The code above will verify the sha256 hash of newly downloaded file
- [module-finder.py](https://github.com/p-cap/anything-PYTHON/blob/main/module-finder.py)    
  Looks for specific modules within python to see they exist. The simple script returns a Boolean expression     
  NOTE: The module of concern was as argument assigned within its source code
